# UpstreamOps

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

> UpstreamOps is a centralized monitoring and operations dashboard for NewAPI and Sub2API upstream sites. It helps manage upstream accounts, balances, spending, model or group rates, rate changes, upstream API keys, recharge and redeem workflows, subscriptions, announcements, and notification alerts.

UpstreamOps is not a model proxy or request forwarding gateway. It is an operations console for maintaining multiple upstream admin panels from one place.

> This project is based on [worryzyy/upstream-hub](https://github.com/worryzyy/upstream-hub). Thanks to [@worryzyy](https://github.com/worryzyy) for the original open-source work.

## Why Use UpstreamOps

When you maintain multiple NewAPI or Sub2API upstream accounts, balance, spending, rates, announcements, API keys, subscriptions, and recharge entry points are usually scattered across different admin panels. Manually logging in one by one is repetitive and can easily miss low balances, rate changes, login failures, expiring subscriptions, or upstream announcements.

UpstreamOps focuses on these problems:

- Centralized status view: balances, spending, rates, announcements, subscriptions, and abnormal states across multiple upstreams.
- Less manual checking: scheduled balance, spending, rate, and subscription usage synchronization.
- Faster risk detection: low balances, rate changes, login failures, monitor failures, low subscription quota, and expiring subscriptions can be pushed through notifications.
- Historical tracking: rate changes, balance snapshots, notification logs, and upstream announcements are stored locally.
- Easier operations: API key management, recharge, redeem, subscription purchase, and renewal are available from one entry point.
- Complex network support: global proxy support with per-upstream, per-notification-channel, and per-captcha-provider proxy switches.

### Upstream Channel Management

- Supports NewAPI and Sub2API upstreams.
- Supports username/password credentials and token/cookie credentials.
- Enables or disables monitoring per channel.
- Configures low-balance alert thresholds.
- Tests login and manually syncs balances and rates.
- Supports extra login form parameters for modified NewAPI or Sub2API login endpoints.
- Supports Cloudflare Turnstile solving for upstream login flows.
- Opens upstream site URLs directly from channel cards.
- Deleting a channel cleans related snapshots, rates, announcements, notification cooldowns, and notification logs.

### Balance and Spending Monitoring

- Shows total balance, today spending, total spending, lowest-balance channel, and abnormal channel count.
- Periodically collects balance and spending data.
- Displays balance history trends.
- Pushes notifications when balance falls below the configured threshold.
- Supports cooldown for repeated low-balance alerts.

- Stores current rate snapshots.
- Records rate change history.
- Supports paginated rate change history and channel filters.
- Sends rate change notifications.
- Merges multiple rate changes from the same scan into one notification.
- Merges added and removed groups in the same scan into one structure-change notification.
- Filters small rate changes by minimum percentage.
- Supports notification subscriptions filtered by upstream channel and rate group.

### Subscription Management and Usage Monitoring

For Sub2API upstream channels, UpstreamOps provides subscription lifecycle management and usage monitoring:

- Queries upstream subscription plans and payment methods.
- Purchases or renews subscriptions.
- Supports QR code, redirect URL, and form-submit payment launch modes.
- Queries daily, weekly, and monthly quota limits, used amount, remaining amount, and remaining percentage.
- Shows subscription expiration time, remaining days, and status.
- Sends low remaining-quota alerts for daily, weekly, and monthly windows.
- Sends expiring-subscription alerts.
- Supports cooldown for repeated subscription alerts.
- Provides summary cards and detail dialogs in the frontend.

### Captcha Provider Balance Management

- Supports CapSolver, 2Captcha, AntiCaptcha, and YesCaptcha.
- Queries captcha provider account balances.
- Refreshes one provider balance manually.
- Refreshes all provider balances in batch.
- Shows balance value, balance unit, refresh time, and error message.

### Global Proxy and Upstream HTTP Settings

- Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 proxies.
- Supports proxy username and password.
- Allows upstream channels, notification channels, and captcha providers to opt in separately.
- Allows version checks to use the proxy separately.
- Configures upstream request timeout and `User-Agent`.
- Provides proxy connectivity testing in the system settings page.

### Upstream Announcements

- Syncs NewAPI announcements from `/api/status` and `/api/notice`.
- Syncs Sub2API user-visible announcements from `/api/v1/announcements`.
- Announcement sync runs with rate sync and does not require a separate cron task.
- The first sync only creates a baseline and does not push historical announcements.
- New announcements are stored locally and pushed through notification channels.
- Shows recent announcements on the dashboard.
- Supports paginated announcement queries and detail views.
- Renders announcement details as Markdown.
- Cleans up related announcements when an upstream channel is deleted.
- Supports retention-based announcement cleanup.
- Supports channel-level `ignore_announcements`.

### Notification Channels

Supported notification channels:

- Telegram
- Webhook
- Email
- WeCom
- DingTalk
- Feishu
- ServerChan3

Notification channels support subscription filters:

- Empty or `[]`: receive all events.
- `mode=all`: receive all events from selected upstreams.
- `mode=groups`: receive only selected rate groups for rate-related events. Announcement, balance, login failure, and monitor failure events are still filtered by upstream channel.

### Upstream API Key Management

From each channel card, you can manage upstream API keys:

- List API keys.
- Search by name or key.
- Filter by status.
- Create API keys.
- Edit name, group, status, quota, expiration time, IP allowlist or blocklist, model restrictions, and related fields.
- Delete API keys.
- Reveal and copy full keys.

Available fields depend on the upstream type and its API capability.

### Recharge and Redeem

From each channel card, you can handle upstream recharge and redeem workflows:

- Query upstream recharge configuration.
- Supports upstream-provided payment methods such as Alipay and WeChat Pay.
- Supports QR code, redirect URL, and form-submit payment launch modes.
- Prefers QR code on desktop and redirect on mobile.
- Redeems redeem codes online.
- Shows returned balance, concurrency, group subscription, validity period, and related results.
- Sub2API channels additionally support subscription purchase and renewal.

### System Settings

The system settings page manages:

- Admin login authentication.
- Admin username and password.
- Token signing secret.
- Balance sync cron.
- Rate sync cron.
- Scheduler concurrency.
- Monitor log, balance snapshot, notification log, and announcement retention.
- Rate change notification merge policy.
- Minimum rate change percentage for notifications.
- Low-balance alert cooldown.
- Daily, weekly, and monthly subscription remaining percentage thresholds.
- Subscription expiration threshold.
- Subscription alert cooldown.
- Maximum notification retry attempts.
- Global proxy configuration.
- Proxy connectivity test.
- Version check result notification.
- Upstream request timeout and `User-Agent`.
- Notification channels.
- Captcha providers.

Saving writes the configuration file. Applying settings hot-reloads authentication, scheduler, notification policy, proxy, and upstream HTTP settings. Notification channels and captcha providers take effect immediately after database writes.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose with SQLite

SQLite is the default deployment mode.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set at least:

```env
APP_SECRET=replace-with-a-random-string-at-least-32-bytes
```

`APP_SECRET` is used to encrypt sensitive fields with AES-GCM, including upstream passwords, tokens, cookies, notification channel secrets, and captcha provider API keys. If you change it later, existing encrypted data cannot be decrypted.

For public access, enable admin login:

```env
AUTH_ENABLED=true
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-strong-password
```

Docker pulls `ghcr.io/bejix/upstream-ops:${IMAGE_TAG:-latest}` by default. Configuration and data are stored in the host `data/` directory.

Start:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Default URL:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Default database file inside the container:

```text
/app/data/upstream-ops.db
```

The host file is `data/upstream-ops.db`. Runtime system settings are persisted to `data/config.yaml`.

### Pin the Image Version

The default image tag comes from `.env`:

```env
IMAGE_TAG=latest
```

For production, pin a specific version:

```env
IMAGE_TAG=v0.0.2
```

## MySQL Deployment

Use the MySQL compose file together with the base compose file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mysql.yml up -d
```

Required `.env` values:

```env
APP_SECRET=replace-with-a-random-string-at-least-32-bytes
MYSQL_DATABASE=upstreamops
MYSQL_USER=upstreamops
MYSQL_PASSWORD=replace-with-database-password
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=replace-with-root-password
MYSQL_PORT=33069
```

## Environment Variables

### Basic

```env
HTTP_PORT=8080
IMAGE_TAG=latest
SERVER_MODE=release
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

- `HTTP_PORT`: host port.
- `IMAGE_TAG`: Docker image tag.
- `SERVER_MODE`: Gin mode, usually `release`.
- `LOG_LEVEL`: log level.

### Database

SQLite:

```env
DATABASE_DRIVER=sqlite
DATABASE_PATH=/app/data/upstream-ops.db
```

MySQL:

```env
DATABASE_DRIVER=mysql
DATABASE_HOST=mysql
DATABASE_PORT=3306
DATABASE_USER=upstreamops
DATABASE_PASSWORD=change-me
DATABASE_NAME=upstreamops
```

### Security and Login

```env
APP_SECRET=please-change-me-to-a-long-random-secret-32bytes-min
AUTH_ENABLED=false
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=
AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=
```

- `APP_SECRET`: required master secret.
- `AUTH_ENABLED`: enables admin login.
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: admin username.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: admin password.
- `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`: token signing secret. Falls back to `APP_SECRET` when empty.

## Local Development

Backend:

```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

Default backend port:

```text
8418
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Default frontend development URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3010
```

Checks:

```bash
go test ./...
```

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm build
```

## Proxy and Upstream HTTP Settings

System settings can configure global proxy and upstream request settings. Proxy is disabled by default, protocol defaults to `http`, upstream timeout defaults to `30` seconds, and `User-Agent` defaults to `upstream-ops/0.1`.

Configuration fields:

```yaml
proxy:
  enabled: false
  versionCheckEnabled: false
  protocol: http
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 7890
  username: ""
  password: ""

upstream:
  timeoutSeconds: 30
  userAgent: upstream-ops/0.1
```

- `proxy.enabled`: enables global proxy.
- `proxy.versionCheckEnabled`: routes version checks through proxy.
- `proxy.protocol`: `http`, `https`, or `socks5`.
- `proxy.host` / `proxy.port`: proxy host and port.
- `proxy.username` / `proxy.password`: optional proxy authentication.
- `upstream.timeoutSeconds`: upstream request timeout.
- `upstream.userAgent`: upstream request `User-Agent`.
- When `proxy.enabled=false`, per-channel `proxy_enabled` settings do not take effect.

Proxy test endpoint:

```text
POST /api/settings/proxy/test
```

## Upstream Channel Configuration

Upstream channels can enable `proxy_enabled` individually. Upstream login, balance sync, rate sync, announcement sync, API key management, recharge, redeem, and subscription APIs use proxy only when both global proxy and channel proxy are enabled.

### NewAPI

NewAPI supports two credential modes.

Username/password mode:

- Provide upstream site URL, username, and password.
- If the login endpoint requires extra fields, provide a JSON object in extra form parameters.
- If Turnstile is enabled, configure a captcha provider first, then enable Turnstile in the channel.

Token/cookie mode:

```json
{
  "cookie": "session=xxx; other=yyy",
  "user_id": "123"
}
```

### Sub2API

Sub2API supports username/password mode and token mode.

Token mode credentials:

```json
{
  "access_token": "your-access-token"
}
```

Token mode does not renew tokens automatically. When the token expires, paste updated credentials.

## Notification Channel Configuration

Notification secrets, webhooks, and SMTP passwords are encrypted at rest. Add or edit a notification channel with the JSON configuration matching its type.

Notification channels can enable `proxy_enabled` individually. Telegram, Webhook, WeCom, DingTalk, Feishu, and ServerChan3 requests use proxy only when both global proxy and notification-channel proxy are enabled.

### Telegram

```json
{
  "bot_token": "1234567890:AAEh...",
  "chat_id": "-1001234567890"
}
```

### Webhook

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/hook",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer xxx"
  }
}
```

Webhook body example:

```json
{
  "event": "announcement",
  "subject": "[UpstreamOps] xxx",
  "body": "notification body",
  "extra": {}
}
```

### Email

```json
{
  "host": "smtp.example.com",
  "port": 465,
  "use_tls": true,
  "username": "alert@example.com",
  "password": "smtp-password-or-app-password",
  "from": "alert@example.com",
  "to": ["ops@example.com"]
}
```

### WeCom

```json
{
  "webhook_url": "https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/webhook/send?key=xxxx"
}
```

### DingTalk

```json
{
  "webhook_url": "https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send?access_token=xxx",
  "secret": "SEC..."
}
```

### Feishu

```json
{
  "webhook_url": "https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/xxxx",
  "secret": "..."
}
```

### ServerChan3

```json
{
  "uid": "your UID",
  "sendkey": "sctp_xxx"
}
```

Messages are sent through `https://{uid}.push.ft07.com/send/{sendkey}.send`.

## Subscription Rules

Notification channels can limit which upstreams, events, or rate groups they receive. Empty value, empty string, `null`, or `[]` means all upstreams and all events.

```json
[
  { "channel_id": 1, "mode": "all" },
  { "channel_id": 2, "mode": "groups", "groups": ["default", "pro"], "events": ["rate_changed"] },
  { "channel_id": 3, "mode": "all", "events": ["announcement", "monitor_failed"] }
]
```

- `channel_id`: upstream channel ID.
- `events`: event type list. Empty means all events for that upstream.
- `mode=all`: receive all rate groups.
- `mode=groups`: receive only selected groups for rate-related events.

## Notification Event Types

- `balance_low`: balance below threshold.
- `rate_changed`: rate changed.
- `rate_structure_changed`: group structure changed.
- `rate_added`: group added. Kept for historical compatibility.
- `rate_removed`: group removed. Kept for historical compatibility.
- `announcement`: new upstream announcement.
- `login_failed`: login failed.
- `captcha_failed`: captcha solving failed.
- `monitor_failed`: balance, spending, or rate collection failed.
- `subscription_daily_remaining_low`: daily subscription remaining quota below threshold.
- `subscription_weekly_remaining_low`: weekly subscription remaining quota below threshold.
- `subscription_monthly_remaining_low`: monthly subscription remaining quota below threshold.
- `subscription_expiring`: subscription is about to expire.

## Runtime Configuration Hot Reload

The system settings page supports runtime hot reload without restarting the service.

Hot-reloadable modules:

- `app`
- `auth`
- `scheduler`
- `notifications`
- `retention`
- `proxy`
- `upstream`

Database connection, HTTP port, and log level still require restart.

## Scheduler and Retention

Default schedules:

- Balance sync: every 15 minutes.
- Rate sync: every 30 minutes.
- Subscription usage check: runs with balance sync.
- Captcha balance refresh: scheduled and manual refresh are supported.
- History cleanup: daily.

Default retention:

- Monitor logs: 30 days.
- Balance snapshots: 90 days.
- Notification logs: 90 days.
- Upstream announcements: controlled by announcement retention days. `0` disables cleanup.
- Rate change logs are not cleaned by default.

## Data Security

The following sensitive fields are encrypted with `APP_SECRET`:

- Upstream account passwords.
- NewAPI cookies.
- Sub2API access tokens.
- Login session cookies and tokens.
- Notification channel secrets.
- SMTP passwords.
- Captcha provider API keys.

Important:

- `APP_SECRET` must remain stable.
- Changing `APP_SECRET` makes existing encrypted data undecryptable.
- Back up `.env` or configuration files together with the database.

## FAQ

### The page opens, but API requests fail

Check whether the backend service is running and whether reverse proxy routes `/api/*` correctly.

Frontend development URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3010
```

Backend URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8418
```

### Upstream login fails

Check the site URL, username, password, Turnstile requirement, captcha provider configuration, and whether token or cookie credentials have expired.

### Announcements are not pushed

Check whether the first announcement baseline sync has completed, rate sync runs successfully, notification channels are enabled, subscription rules include the upstream, and failed notification logs exist.

### Rate changes are not pushed

Check the minimum change percentage, notification subscription groups, and rate change history.

### Added or removed groups are not pushed

Added and removed groups are merged into a `rate_structure_changed` notification for the same scan. If a notification channel uses `mode=groups`, the added/removed list is filtered by subscribed groups before generating the notification.

The first rate sync only creates a baseline and does not push all existing groups as newly added groups.

### Low-balance alerts repeat too rarely

Check the low-balance alert cooldown in system settings. Cooldown state is stored in the database and survives restarts.
